> In many ways, Nick Santonastasso is like any other 20-year-old: he’s youthful, full of life, and loves to be fit and active. But spend even a little time with him and you’ll realize how extraordinary he is. Santonastasso was born with Hanhart Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that manifests itself with either unformed organs or limbs. Brimming with a drive and determination that inspires others, nothing has stopped him from chasing his dream of being a fitness model and bodybuilder.

(upbeat music)

You can have a regular normal
body guy with his shirt off

trying to inspire people,

or you can have me,

a guy with no legs and one arm.

(somber music)

My name's Nick Santonastasso,

I have Hanhart Syndrome,

and Hanhart Syndrome
is a rare genetic disorder

which either leaves the
baby with undeveloped limbs

or undeveloped organs.

In my case, it was just
my limbs that were,

you know, affected.

Middle school was like my rock bottom.

I was always asking, you know,

why was I born like this?

Had suicidal thoughts.

Wrestling started me on, you
know, the answer to why.

I had to have standing
ovations when I lost,

and I just didn't understand

because I'm a very competitive person,

I'm like, you're not supposed to cheer on

someone that loses.

After the matches, I'd
have parents come up to me

and be like hey,

my kid never did a sport,

and he saw you today,
and now he's signed up

for all these sports, you know,

because he sees that if you're doing it,

there's no excuse for him not to.

It was like, that's why I'm here,

and I wanted to break
into the fitness industry,

because I was inspired
by these fitness guys

that, you know, sit around
with their six pack

next to their nice car,

but getting into it,
it's much more than that,

it's how you can move people and show them

that, like, living a healthy
lifestyle is not as hard

as you think it is,

especially if I can do it.

My life revolves around, you know,

eating and training and posting.

(camera flashes)

I look at being fit,

I look at motivating
and inspiring as a duty.

I got a message from a UK mom,

she had twins and one of the
twin’s legs had to be amputated,

she said that they watched the videos together

and he goes, like me, mom,

he's like me, mom.

I didn't have that as a kid,

I didn't have someone to look up to.

That kid can you know, oh,

I don't know how to do this,

let me look at Nick's page.

That's why I do this.
