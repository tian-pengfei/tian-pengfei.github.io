Tiandy's Struggle

Once upon a time in a bustling city, there lived a young man named Tiandy. He was a diligent student majoring in computer science, and his senior thesis was his ticket to graduation. Despite his efforts, Tiandy's journey was about to take an unexpected turn.

Tiandy had to come along with a unique idea for his senior thesis, something that would stand out. However, he found himself stuck in the web of procrastination, unable to start off on his project. As the deadline loomed, anxiety and dread began to guard over him like a shadow.

His hypothesis was that he could create a revolutionary mechanism, a self-starter project that would showcase his entrepreneurial spirit. However, as the days passed, his once-productive energy dwindled, and the consequences of his procrastination became apparent. Tiandy's grades plummeted, and the once-promising future he envisioned began to crumble.

Upon graduation, Tiandy struggled to find a job in his field. The job market was mayhem, and despite his best efforts, he ended up in a position that was far from ideal. His guardian angel seemed to have abandoned him, and he felt like a spectator in his own life, sneaky and unnoticed.

Tiandy's days were filled with frustration as he tried to stay aware of his shortcomings. The advanced civilization he had envisioned seemed like a distant dream. In the tribal times of the corporate world, he felt like an outsider, unable to overlap with the expectations of his colleagues.

As he visualized a future filled with success, Tiandy's reality clashed with his dreams. The contrast between what he had hoped for and what he was experiencing was overwhelming. The effect of constant failure took a toll on his mental well-being, leaving him perplexed and isolated.

Tiandy desperately sought gratification in his work, but it remained elusive. The species of self-doubt and disappointment began to propagate in his mind. He became the embodiment of a person who is terrified of facing the world and unable to strike a balance between personal and professional life.

In this lonely journey, Tiandy longed for a guardian angel to watch over him, to guide him through the dark clouds that shrouded his life. Despite his best efforts to revise his situation, the circumstances seemed to bump up against him at every turn.

Tiandy's life became a constant struggle, a sprint across the campus of hardships. The once-promising graduate now faced the consequences of his choices, and the leisure he had envisioned was replaced by the harsh reality of an unfulfilling job and a lack of understanding from those around him.

And so, Tiandy's story serves as a cautionary tale for those who embark on the journey of life, reminding us all of the importance of perseverance, self-reflection, and the ability to adapt to the unexpected twists that come our way.
