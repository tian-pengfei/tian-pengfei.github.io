Buckley had this television program</p> <p>called “Firing Line,”</p> <p>and Ginsberg went on there and sang a Hare Krishna song</p> <p>while playing the harmonium.</p> <p>And he got back to New York to all his intelligentsia friends,</p> <p>and they all told him,</p> <p>“Don’t you know that everybody thinks you’re an idiot,</p> <p>and the whole country’s making fun of you?”</p> <p>And he said, “That’s my job.</p> <p>I’m a poet, and I’m going to play the fool.</p> <p>Most people have to go to work all day long,</p> <p>and they come home and they fight with their spouse,</p> <p>and they eat, and they turn on the old boob tube,</p> <p>and somebody tries to sell them something,</p> <p>and I just screwed all that up.</p> <p>I went on and I sang about Krishna,</p> <p>and now they’re sitting in bed and going, ‘Who is this stupid poet?’</p> <p>And they can’t fall asleep, right?”</p> <p>And that’s his job as a poet.</p> <p>And so, I find that very liberating,</p> <p>because I think that most of us really want to offer the world</p> <p>something of quality,</p> <p>something that the world will consider good or important.</p> <hr> <p>And that’s really the enemy,</p> <p>because it’s not up to us whether what we do is any good,</p> <p>and if history has taught us anything,</p> <p>the world is an extremely unreliable critic.</p> <p>Right?</p> <p>So you have to ask yourself:</p> <p>Do you think human creativity matters?</p> <p>Well, hmm.</p> <p>Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right?</p> <p>They have a life to live,</p> <p>and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems</p> <p>or anybody’s poems,</p> <p>until their father dies,</p> <p>they go to a funeral,</p> <p>you lose a child,</p> <p>somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore,</p> <p>and all of a sudden,</p> <p>you’re desperate for making sense out of this life,</p> <p>and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before?</p> <p>How did they come out of this cloud?”</p> <p>Or the inverse – something great.</p> <p>You meet somebody and your heart explodes.</p> <p>You love them so much, you can’t even see straight.</p> <p>You know, you’re dizzy.</p> <p>“Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?”</p> <p>And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance.</p> <p>We need it.</p> <p>OK. Well, what is it?</p> <p>Human creativity is nature manifest in us.</p> <p>We look at the, oh …</p> <p>the aurora borealis. Right?</p> <p>I did this movie called “White Fang” when I was a kid,</p> <p>and we shot up in Alaska,</p> <p>and you go out at night</p> <p>and the sky was like rippling with purple and pink and white,</p> <p>and it’s the most beautiful thing I ever saw.</p> <p>It really looked like the sky was playing.</p> <p>Beautiful.</p> <p>You go to Grand Canyon at sundown.</p> <p>It’s beautiful.</p> <p>We know that’s beautiful.</p> <p>But fall in love?</p> <p>Your lover’s pretty beautiful.</p> <p>I have four kids.</p> <p>Watching them play?</p> <p>Watching them pretend to be a butterfly</p> <p>or run around the house and doing anything,</p> <p>it’s so beautiful.</p> <hr> <p>And I believe that we are here on this star in space</p> <p>to try to help one another. Right?</p> <p>And first we have to survive,</p> <p>and then we have to thrive.</p> <p>And to thrive, to express ourselves,</p> <p>alright, well, here’s the rub: we have to know ourselves.</p> <p>What do you love?</p> <p>And if you get close to what you love,</p> <p>who you are is revealed to you,</p> <p>and it expands.</p> <p>For me, it was really easy.</p> <p>I did my first professional play. I was 12 years old.</p> <p>I was in a play called “Saint Joan” by George Bernard Shaw</p> <p>at the McCarter Theatre,</p> <p>and – boom! – I was in love.</p> <p>My world just expanded.</p> <p>And that profession – I’m almost 50 now –</p> <p>that profession has never stopped giving back to me,</p> <p>and it gives back more and more,</p> <p>mostly, strangely,</p> <p>through the characters that I’ve played.</p> <p>I’ve played cops, I’ve played criminals,</p> <p>I’ve played priests, I’ve played sinners,</p> <p>and the magic of this over a lifetime, over 30 years of doing this,</p> <p>is that you start to see that my experiences,</p> <p>me, Ethan, is not nearly as unique</p> <p>as I thought.</p> <p>I have so much in common with all these people.</p> <p>And so they have something in common with me.</p> <p>You start to see how connected we all are.</p> <p>My great-grandmother, Della Hall Walker Green,</p> <p>on her deathbed,</p> <p>she wrote this little biography in the hospital,</p> <p>and it was only about 36 pages long,</p> <p>and she spent about five pages</p> <p>on the one time she did costumes for a play.</p> <p>Her first husband got, like, a paragraph.</p> <p>Cotton farming, of which she did for 50 years, gets a mention.</p> <p>Five pages on doing these costumes.</p> <p>And I look – my mom gave me one of her quilts that she made,</p> <p>and you can feel it.</p> <p>She was expressing herself,</p> <p>and it has a power that’s real.</p> <hr> <p>I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see “Top Gun,”</p> <p>whatever year that came out.</p> <p>And I remember we walked out of the mall, it was, like, blazing hot,</p> <p>I just looked at him,</p> <p>and we both felt that movie just like a calling from God.</p> <p>You know? Just …</p> <p>But completely differently.</p> <p>Like, I wanted to be an actor.</p> <p>I was like, I’ve got to make something that makes people feel.</p> <p>I just want to be a part of that.</p> <p>And he wanted to be in the military.</p> <p>That’s all we ever did was play FBI, play army man,</p> <p>play knights, you know, and I’d like, pose with my sword,</p> <p>and he would build a working crossbow</p> <p>that you could shoot an arrow into a tree.</p> <p>So he joins the army.</p> <p>Well, he just retired a colonel in the Green Berets.</p> <p>He’s a multidecorated combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>He now teaches a sail camp for children of fallen soldiers.</p> <p>He gave his life to his passion.</p> <p>His creativity was leadership,</p> <p>leading others,</p> <p>his bravery, to help others.</p> <p>That was something he felt called to do,</p> <p>and it gave back to him.</p> <hr> <p>We know this – the time of our life is so short,</p> <p>and how we spend it –</p> <p>are we spending it doing what’s important to us?</p> <p>Most of us not.</p> <p>I mean, it’s hard.</p> <p>The pull of habit is so huge,</p> <p>and that’s what makes kids so beautifully creative,</p> <p>is that they don’t have any habits,</p> <p>and they don’t care if they’re any good or not, right?</p> <p>They’re not building a sandcastle going,</p> <p>“I think I’m going to be a really good sandcastle builder.”</p> <p>They just throw themselves at whatever project you put in front of them –</p> <p>dancing, doing a painting,</p> <p>building something:</p> <p>any opportunity they have,</p> <p>they try to use it to impress upon you their individuality.</p> <p>It’s so beautiful.</p> <p>It’s a thing that worries me sometimes whenever you talk about creativity,</p> <p>because it can have this kind of feel that it’s just nice,</p> <p>you know, or it’s warm or it’s something pleasant.</p> <p>It’s not.</p> <p>It’s vital.</p> <p>It’s the way we heal each other.</p> <p>In singing our song,</p> <p>in telling our story,</p> <p>in inviting you to say,</p> <p>“Hey, listen to me, and I’ll listen to you,”</p> <p>we’re starting a dialogue.</p> <p>And when you do that, this healing happens,</p> <p>and we come out of our corners,</p> <p>and we start to witness each other’s common humanity.</p> <p>We start to assert it.</p> <p>And when we do that, really good things happen.</p> <p>So, if you want to help your community, if you want to help your family,</p> <p>if you want to help your friends,</p> <p>you have to express yourself.</p> <p>And to express yourself, you have to know yourself.</p> <p>It’s actually super easy.</p> <p>You just have to follow your love.</p> <p>There is no path.</p> <p>There’s no path till you walk it,</p> <p>and you have to be willing to play the fool.</p> <p>So don’t read the book that you should read,</p> <p>read the book you want to read.</p> <p>Don’t listen to the music that you used to like.</p> <p>Take some time to listen to some new music.</p> <p>Take some time to talk to somebody that you don’t normally talk to.</p> <p>I guarantee, if you do that,</p> <p>you will feel foolish.</p> <p>That’s the point.</p> <p>Play the fool.</p> <p>(Plays guitar)</p> <p>(Sings) Well, I want to go Austin, and I wanna stay home.</p> <p>Invite our friends over but still be alone.</p> <p>Live for danger.</p> <p>Play it cool.</p> <p>Have everyone respect me for being a fool.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Tiandy Tian.
