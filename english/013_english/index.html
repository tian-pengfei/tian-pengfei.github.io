In this provocative talk, Jay says that just because marriage, work and kids are happening later in life, doesn’t mean you can’t start planning now. She gives 3 pieces of advice for how twentysomethings can re-claim adulthood in the defining decade of their lives.</p> </blockquote> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>

<p>She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.</p> <p>Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,</p> <p>and she dropped onto the couch in my office</p> <p>and kicked off her flats</p> <p>and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.</p> <p>Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.</p> <p>My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.</p> <p>(Laughter)</p> <p>And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.</p> <p>This I thought I could handle.</p> <p>But I didn’t handle it.</p> <p>With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,</p> <p>it was easy for me just to nod my head</p> <p>while we kicked the can down the road.</p> <p>“Thirty’s the new 20,” Alex would say,</p> <p>and as far as I could tell, she was right.</p> <p>Work happened later, marriage happened later,</p> <p>kids happened later, even death happened later.</p> <p>Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.</p> <p>But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.</p> <p>I pushed back.</p> <p>I said, “Sure, she’s dating down,</p> <p>she’s sleeping with a knucklehead,</p> <p>but it’s not like she’s going to marry the guy.”</p> <p>And then my supervisor said,</p> <p>“Not yet, but she might marry the next one.</p> <p>Besides, the best time to work on Alex’s marriage</p> <p>is before she has one.”</p> <p>That’s what psychologists call an “Aha!” moment.</p> <p>That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.</p> <p>Yes, people settle down later than they used to,</p> <p>but that didn’t make Alex’s 20s a developmental downtime.</p> <p>That made Alex’s 20s a developmental sweet spot,</p> <p>and we were sitting there, blowing it.</p> <p>That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect</p> <p>was a real problem, and it had real consequences,</p> <p>not just for Alex and her love life</p> <p>but for the careers and the families and the futures</p> <p>of twentysomethings everywhere.</p> <p>There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.</p> <p>We’re talking about 15 percent of the population,</p> <p>or 100 percent if you consider</p> <p>that no one’s getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.</p> <p>(Laughter)</p> <hr> <p>Raise your hand if you’re in your 20s.</p> <p>I really want to see some twentysomethings here.</p> <p>Oh, yay! You are all awesome.</p> <p>If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,</p> <p>you’re losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see —</p> <p>Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.</p> <p>So, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe</p> <p>that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings</p> <p>deserves to know what psychologists,</p> <p>sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists</p> <p>already know:</p> <p>that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,</p> <p>yet most transformative, things you can do</p> <p>for work, for love, for your happiness,</p> <p>maybe even for the world.</p> <p>This is not my opinion.</p> <p>These are the facts.</p> <p>We know that 80 percent of life’s most defining moments</p> <p>take place by age 35.</p> <p>That means that eight out of 10</p> <p>of the decisions and experiences and “Aha!” moments</p> <p>that make your life what it is</p> <p>will have happened by your mid-30s.</p> <p>People who are over 40, don’t panic.</p> <p>This crowd is going to be fine, I think.</p> <p>We know that the first 10 years of a career</p> <p>has an exponential impact on how much money you’re going to earn.</p> <p>We know that more than half of Americans</p> <p>are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.</p> <p>We know that the brain caps off</p> <p>its second and last growth spurt in your 20s</p> <p>as it rewires itself for adulthood,</p> <p>which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,</p> <p>now is the time to change it.</p> <p>We know that personality changes more during your 20s</p> <p>than at any other time in life,</p> <p>and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,</p> <p>and things get tricky after age 35.</p> <p>So your 20s are the time to educate yourself</p> <p>about your body and your options.</p> <p>So when we think about child development,</p> <p>we all know that the first five years are a critical period</p> <p>for language and attachment in the brain.</p> <p>It’s a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life</p> <p>has an inordinate impact on who you will become.</p> <p>But what we hear less about is that there’s such a thing</p> <p>as adult development,</p> <p>and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.</p> <p>But this isn’t what twentysomethings are hearing.</p> <hr> <p>Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.</p> <p>Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.</p> <p>Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings</p> <p>like “twixters” and “kidults.”</p> <p>(Laughing) It’s true!</p> <p>As a culture, we have trivialized</p> <p>what is actually the defining decade of adulthood.</p> <p>Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,</p> <p>you need a plan and not quite enough time.</p> <p>(Laughing) Isn’t that true?</p> <p>So what do you think happens</p> <p>when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,</p> <p>“You have 10 extra years to start your life”?</p> <p>Nothing happens.</p> <p>You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,</p> <p>and absolutely nothing happens.</p> <p>And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings</p> <p>like you or like your sons and daughters</p> <p>come into my office and say things like this:</p> <p>“I know my boyfriend’s no good for me,</p> <p>but this relationship doesn’t count. I’m just killing time.”</p> <p>Or they say, “Everybody says as long as I get started</p> <p>on a career by the time I’m 30, I’ll be fine.”</p> <p>But then it starts to sound like this:</p> <p>“My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.</p> <p>I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college.”</p> <p>And then it starts to sound like this:</p> <p>“Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.</p> <p>Everybody was running around and having fun,</p> <p>but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off</p> <p>and everybody started sitting down.</p> <p>I didn’t want to be the only one left standing up,</p> <p>so sometimes I think I married my husband</p> <p>because he was the closest chair to me at 30.”</p> <p>Where are the twentysomethings here?</p> <p>Do not do that.</p> <p>(Laughter)</p> <p>Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,</p> <p>the stakes are very high.</p> <p>When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,</p> <p>there is enormous thirtysomething pressure</p> <p>to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,</p> <p>and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.</p> <p>Many of these things are incompatible,</p> <p>and as research is just starting to show,</p> <p>simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.</p> <p>The post-millennial midlife crisis isn’t buying a red sports car.</p> <p>It’s realizing you can’t have that career you now want.</p> <p>It’s realizing you can’t have that child you now want,</p> <p>or you can’t give your child a sibling.</p> <p>Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings</p> <p>look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,</p> <p>and say about their 20s,</p> <p>“What was I doing? What was I thinking?”</p> <p>I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.</p> <hr> <p>Here’s a story about how that can go.</p> <p>It’s a story about a woman named Emma.</p> <p>At 25, Emma came to my office</p> <p>because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.</p> <p>She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,</p> <p>but she hadn’t decided yet,</p> <p>so she’d spent the last few years waiting tables instead.</p> <p>Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend</p> <p>who displayed his temper more than his ambition.</p> <p>And as hard as her 20s were,</p> <p>her early life had been even harder.</p> <p>She often cried in our sessions,</p> <p>but then would collect herself by saying,</p> <p>“You can’t pick your family, but you can pick your friends.”</p> <p>Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,</p> <p>and she sobbed for most of the hour.</p> <p>She’d just bought a new address book,</p> <p>and she’d spent the morning filling in her many contacts,</p> <p>but then she’d been left staring at that empty blank</p> <p>that comes after the words</p> <p>“In case of emergency, please call …”</p> <p>She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,</p> <p>“Who’s going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?</p> <p>Who’s going to take care of me if I have cancer?”</p> <p>Now in that moment, it took everything I had</p> <p>not to say, “I will.”</p> <p>But what Emma needed wasn’t some therapist who really, really cared.</p> <p>Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.</p> <p>I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex</p> <p>to just sit there while Emma’s defining decade</p> <p>went parading by.</p> <hr> <p>So over the next weeks and months,</p> <p>I told Emma three things</p> <p>that every twentysomething, male or female,</p> <p>deserves to hear.</p> <p>First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis</p> <p>and get some identity capital.</p> <p>By “get identity capital,”</p> <p>I mean do something that adds value to who you are.</p> <p>Do something that’s an investment</p> <p>in who you might want to be next.</p> <p>I didn’t know the future of Emma’s career,</p> <p>and no one knows the future of work,</p> <p>but I do know this:</p> <p>Identity capital begets identity capital.</p> <p>So now is the time for that cross-country job,</p> <p>that internship, that startup you want to try.</p> <p>I’m not discounting twentysomething exploration here,</p> <p>but I am discounting exploration that’s not supposed to count,</p> <p>which, by the way, is not exploration.</p> <p>That’s procrastination.</p> <p>I told Emma to explore work and make it count.</p> <p>Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.</p> <p>Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport,</p> <p>but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers</p> <p>limit who they know,</p> <p>what they know, how they think,</p> <p>how they speak, and where they work.</p> <p>That new piece of capital, that new person to date</p> <p>almost always comes from outside the inner circle.</p> <p>New things come from what are called our weak ties,</p> <p>our friends of friends of friends.</p> <p>So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.</p> <p>But half aren’t,</p> <p>and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.</p> <p>Half of new jobs are never posted,</p> <p>so reaching out to your neighbor’s boss is how you get that unposted job.</p> <p>It’s not cheating. It’s the science of how information spreads.</p> <p>Last but not least, Emma believed</p> <p>that you can’t pick your family, but you can pick your friends.</p> <p>Now this was true for her growing up,</p> <p>but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family</p> <p>when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.</p> <p>I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.</p> <p>Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down</p> <p>than 20, or even 25,</p> <p>and I agree with you.</p> <p>But grabbing whoever you’re living with or sleeping with</p> <p>when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle</p> <p>is not progress.</p> <p>The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,</p> <p>and that means being as intentional with love</p> <p>as you are with work.</p> <p>Picking your family is about consciously choosing</p> <p>who and what you want</p> <p>rather than just making it work or killing time</p> <p>with whoever happens to be choosing you.</p> <hr> <p>So what happened to Emma?</p> <p>Well, we went through that address book,</p> <p>and she found an old roommate’s cousin</p> <p>who worked at an art museum in another state.</p> <p>That weak tie helped her get a job there.</p> <p>That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.</p> <p>Now, five years later, she’s a special events planner for museums.</p> <p>She’s married to a man she mindfully chose.</p> <p>She loves her new career, she loves her new family,</p> <p>and she sent me a card that said,</p> <p>“Now the emergency contact blanks</p> <p>don’t seem big enough.”</p> <p>Now Emma’s story made that sound easy,</p> <p>but that’s what I love about working with twentysomethings.</p> <p>They are so easy to help.</p> <p>Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,</p> <p>bound for somewhere west.</p> <p>Right after takeoff, a slight change in course</p> <p>is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.</p> <p>Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,</p> <p>one good conversation, one good break,</p> <p>one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect</p> <p>across years and even generations to come.</p> <p>So here’s an idea worth spreading</p> <p>to every twentysomething you know.</p> <p>It’s as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.</p> <p>It’s what I now have the privilege</p> <p>of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:</p> <p>Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,</p> <p>get some identity capital, use your weak ties,</p> <p>pick your family.</p> <p>Don’t be defined by what you didn’t know</p> <p>or didn’t do.</p> <p>You’re deciding your life right now.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>(Applause)</p> <h2 id="vocabulary">vocabulary</h2> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Tiandy Tian.
