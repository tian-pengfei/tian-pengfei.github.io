> Do you recall where you were and what you were up to when you first got wind of the COVID-19 virus?




​	I became aware of this infectious disease through the trending topics on Weibo. Initially, I didn't take it seriously. Around that time, I had just graduated and completed the postgraduate entrance exam. As the Chinese New Year approached, I returned to my hometown.

​	I assumed that this infectious disease would disappear after a few weeks, and no one would mention it, just like before. However, the situation escalated, and the virus became more and more significant. During that period, my brother was in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, and we couldn't reunite for the Chinese New Year. The atmosphere during that Spring Festival was unsettling.



> During the pandemic, what stands out most in your memory?

The most unforgettable experience for me during the pandemic was when I was suspected of being in close contact with an infected person and was placed in  a hotel for 16 days, unable to leave. In the initial stages of that period, I felt overwhelmed and stifled. Being alone in the room made me somewhat restless, but over time, I learned to cope with myself, and my inner turmoil gradually subsided.

This incident left a profound impact on me. Fortunately, we eventually managed to get rid of this virus, thanks to the dedicated efforts of many individuals. we often felt exhausted cause of virus.  In the end, we successfully overcame this virus, and it was truly relieving.



> In your own culture, are there any traditions or customs that you dislike?

​	In Chinese culture, there is a traditional belief that cutting hair during the first month of the lunar calendar (Chinese New Year) may bring about misfortune.





**I bought some books, but many of them haven't been read. When I went to Fuzhou before, I brought a book with me. I started reading it on the high-speed train. Initially, I couldn't calm down, but after reading for a while, I gradually got into it. It felt really good**



**In the present moment, short videos are prevalent. I've realized that after watching short videos for a while, I find it difficult to calm down and read something, or engage with content that requires more time. I end up just wanting to watch short, valueless videos. Reflecting on this, I feel a bit regretful.**

coffe:

I have recently developed a liking for drinking coffee. It truly helps me stay energized during work, and I enjoy that feeling. I usually have a cup of coffee after waking up from a nap and before starting my afternoon work. Sometimes, I buy my coffee from Luckin Coffee Shop, and at other times, I just have instant coffee.

When do you usually drink coffee during the day?
