No big deal. Just three stories.</p> <p>The first story is about connecting the dots.</p> <p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months.</p> <p>But then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.</p> <p>So why did I drop out? It started before I was born.</p> <p>My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student.</p> <p>And she decided to put me up for adoption.</p> <p>She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.</p> <p>Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.</p> <p>So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking.</p> <p>” We got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him? “</p> <p>They said: “ Of course.”</p> <p>My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.</p> <p>She refused to sign the final adoption papers.</p> <p>She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.</p> <p>This was the start in my life.</p> <p>And 17 years later I did go to college.</p> <p>But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford.</p> <p>And all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition.</p> <p>After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it.</p> <p>I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.</p> <p>And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.</p> <p>So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.</p> <p>It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.</p> <p>The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.</p> <p>It wasn’t all romantic.</p> <p>I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms.</p> <p>I returned coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.</p> <p>I loved it.</p> <p>And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.</p> <p>Let me give you one example.</p> <p>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.</p> <p>Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.</p> <p>Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes.</p> <p>I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.</p> <p>I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great.</p> <p>It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p> <p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.</p> <p>But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.</p> <p>And we designed it all into the Mac.</p> <p>It was the first computer with beautiful typography.</p> <p>If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.</p> <p>And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them.</p> <p>If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.</p> <p>Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.</p> <p>But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.</p> <p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.</p> <p>So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</p> <p>You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.</p> <p>Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Tiandy Tian.
