id="conversation">Conversation</h2> <p>Welcome to the InFluency Podcast.</p> <p>I’m Hadar, and this is episode number 210.</p> <p>And today we’re going to talk about control and how staying in control</p> <p>affects every bit of your fluency.</p> <p>Hey everyone.</p> <p>Thank you so much for tuning in for another episode.</p> <p>So today, as you realized, we are going to talk about control - and</p> <p>not the pronunciation of the word.</p> <p>So I’m not going to talk about the dark L at the end, I’m not going to</p> <p>talk about the schwa at the beginning.</p> <p>No, I’m going to talk about staying in control and having the need to</p> <p>be in control when speaking English.</p> <p>I’ve talked in the past about perfectionism and how</p> <p>perfectionism is detrimental.</p> <p>It’s horrendous, it’s ruining your chances for fluency, for feeling free.</p> <p>Because perfectionism is having that sense that unless I speak correctly, unless I</p> <p>don’t make mistakes, unless I know exactly what I need to say, I will not speak.</p> <p>It’s not conscious.</p> <p>It’s not like you’re saying to yourself, “I’m not going to</p> <p>speak unless I know everything.”</p> <p>But it’s subconscious.</p> <p>The action that you take is based on a certain belief that you have.</p> <p>And usually that belief is, “I’m just not going to speak unless I have it all</p> <p>figured out in my head or unless I know exactly how to say it, or unless I’m</p> <p>not struggling with any of the words.”</p> <p>And the results - you not speaking often enough, or as often as you should be</p> <p>speaking - is proof that you have this belief that it needs to be perfect.</p> <p>So, I talk a lot about perfectionism.</p> <p>And I have an episode just about that, that I’m going to</p> <p>link to it in the show notes.</p> <p>So if that resonates with you, I highly recommend that you listen to it.</p> <p>But today I want to address it from a different angle.</p> <p>And that angle is that false sense of control when speaking a language.</p> <p>Or at least the need to be in control.</p> <p>Now, I’m going to start by saying that I am a person who likes</p> <p>very much to be in control.</p> <p>I need to know exactly what’s happening every single day.</p> <p>If my husband is planning something, I need to know every single detail.</p> <p>And you bet that I will have something to say about it (sorry, Gil).</p> <p>If I’m building something or creating something in my business,</p> <p>I need to know exactly what are the steps and where things are going.</p> <p>Now, I’ve gotten better at it.</p> <p>So I’m not as bad as I used to be, but I needed to have</p> <p>everything under my control.</p> <p>And it’s so hard to let go of control.</p> <p>Luckily, I have an amazing team that allows me to give</p> <p>up on some of my control.</p> <p>But usually in life, you know, I don’t always feel like I can just let go.</p> <p>Now, yes, the deeper belief in that is that if I let go, things are</p> <p>not going to work out properly.</p> <p>It’s not going to be right.</p> <p>It’s not going to be how I want it to be.</p> <p>And everything’s dependent on me.</p> <p>Which is very narcissistic, if I can just add.</p> <p>Right?</p> <p>It’s like, “I’m the only person who can do it right.</p> <p>And if I don’t do it right then it’s not going to get done.”</p> <p>So, it’s not realistic, it’s not true.</p> <p>And like I said, I’m learning how to let go of that belief.</p> <p>I wasn’t…</p> <p>I wouldn’t be able to be where I am today, had I not given up on that belief.</p> <p>But I know what it’s like to be in control.</p> <p>And I know I still have it, especially in my personal life.</p> <p>And my team will say it that I still have it in my business, I guarantee.</p> <p>But I have gotten better.</p> <p>So, why am I telling you all that?</p> <p>Because if you can relate to something that I said here about that sense of</p> <p>control, I’m inviting you to check in with yourself and see how that</p> <p>manifests into your English when you’re speaking, because it always does.</p> <p>English is a reflection of every aspect in our lives.</p> <p>If we don’t have the confidence to speak or to do something or to show up</p> <p>or to put ourselves out there, it is rooted in something much, much deeper.</p> <p>That is manifested in other areas of our lives: our relationships,</p> <p>our career, our family.</p> <p>But we can definitely see it in English too.</p> <p>So, if you find yourself struggling with letting go of control, in this episode I</p> <p>want to talk about how that’s manifested in your English and how that’s preventing</p> <p>you from having that innate freedom.</p> <p>So, yeah, let’s begin with that idea that freedom is</p> <p>something that is not controlled.</p> <p>Once you control something, that something is oppressed, it’s enslaved, it’s</p> <p>limited because you’re controlling it.</p> <p>And when you’re trying to have something go according to how you plan</p> <p>it, there is no creativity, there are no surprises, there is no discovery.</p> <p>And I want you to think of a language as something that is constantly evolving,</p> <p>like a plant or a tree or grass; that it keeps changing all the time.</p> <p>And if you put it in a controlled environment, let’s say like a</p> <p>pot - put a big tree in a small pot.</p> <p>So it starts growing, but then when it stays inside the pot,</p> <p>it’s not going to grow a lot more than what the pot allows it.</p> <p>That is a controlled environment.</p> <p>So when you think of your English like that, you need to understand that when you</p> <p>want to be in control a hundred percent of the times of what comes out of your mouth,</p> <p>you’re going to always A - feel limited, and B - limit the possibility of freedom.</p> <p>So I’m going to explain that.</p> <p>You’re going to always feel limited because whatever comes out of your</p> <p>mouth is never going to be exactly like it’s planned out in your head.</p> <p>That’s just science.</p> <p>I don’t know, it’s usually impossible unless you rehearse it all the time.</p> <p>What comes out of our mouth is a lot more organic and has sometimes its own life.</p> <p>So you’re going to feel limited.</p> <p>But by controlling it, you will not have that beauty of discovery and</p> <p>freedom, and you will limit your English and all the potential that</p> <p>you have, and you have a lot of it.</p> <p>Now, what does it mean to control what comes out of your mouth?</p> <p>What does it look like?</p> <p>Well, it looks like not saying words that you’re not sure of</p> <p>how to say them or use them.</p> <p>You’re not using words that you struggle with their pronunciation</p> <p>because you’re afraid that people are not going to understand you.</p> <p>That means that when you have something a little more complex to say than,</p> <p>you know, ‘how’s the weather?’, you might stop yourself because you</p> <p>don’t know what’s going to come out of your mouth and you’re afraid that</p> <p>it’s not going to be satisfactory.</p> <p>So you’re not going to say it.</p> <p>And in general, you might just limit yourself to small sentences,</p> <p>to doing a little less speaking so that you always feel in control</p> <p>and you’re not out of control.</p> <p>You know that thing, for those of you who drink wine or alcohol - I know</p> <p>not everyone does, so I apologize if this is not relevant to you - but</p> <p>you know that thing when you’re sitting for dinner with a friend.</p> <p>And, you know, you have a conversation and you show them just a part of who you are.</p> <p>It’s kind of like, everything is controlled.</p> <p>We’re always controlling ourselves when we are in company, unless it’s</p> <p>with people who are really close to us.</p> <p>That’s because we try to be the person we think they want us to be.</p> <p>And, um, and then you have a glass of wine, and then you</p> <p>have another glass of wine.</p> <p>And then you start talking freely without thinking about</p> <p>how this person perceives you.</p> <p>Because all that comes out is, you know, what you have to say at that moment.</p> <p>And yes, sometimes it could be a bit too much.</p> <p>And then the next day you’re like, “Oh my God, I did not stop talking all evening.</p> <p>What was I blabbing about?</p> <p>Why did I have to talk about my football practice for like 25 minutes?”</p> <p>And no, I have never had any football or soccer practice, this is just an example.</p> <p>But you get what I’m saying?</p> <p>Like you have that feeling that you are out of control.</p> <p>But in that moment there was you being present and you being free.</p> <p>And while it may not obey some social norms…</p> <p>And yes, sometimes we don’t want to do all the talking all the time,</p> <p>we also want to listen to others.</p> <p>But with that, that sense of freedom of ‘I don’t give a crap about</p> <p>what people say’ is the epitome of not being in control, not being</p> <p>controlled by your conscious mind.</p> <p>Now, I’m not saying start drinking and speaking.</p> <p>I’m just saying, what if you decide to let go of that control a little bit more?</p> <p>What if you decide not to have it all figured out when you start speaking?</p> <p>What if you decide that you’re going to use those new words, even though you’re</p> <p>not certain 100% that you’re going to use them correctly or in the right context?</p> <p>What if you decide to let go of the tight grip that you hold your</p> <p>English and your performance?</p> <p>What if you surrender to, “Whatever comes out - comes out.</p> <p>I’m here for the long haul, not just for that one conversation.</p> <p>And I know that when I give myself that freedom, I may make mistakes,</p> <p>but I’m also growing and learning.”</p> <p>So, if you are the kind of person who needs to be in control of things, you’re</p> <p>probably doing it in English as well.</p> <p>And that really, really interacts well with perfectionism.</p> <p>Because again, what is perfectionism?</p> <p>Control.</p> <p>‘If it’s not this, then it’s not okay.</p> <p>Cannot come out’.</p> <p>And if I haven’t convinced you yet, I’m going to say that again - that</p> <p>control and keeping that tight grip will never allow you to reach true freedom.</p> <p>No matter how much you practice and how much you’ll learn</p> <p>grammar and pronunciation.</p> <p>I’m inviting you to surrender to the unexpected and to being in the present</p> <p>and in the moment when speaking.</p> <p>I’m inviting you to laugh at your mistakes while you’re making them, and after.</p> <p>I’m inviting you to dare more.</p> <p>Because when you do, it really makes all the difference.</p> <p>All the difference.</p> <p>Really think of it like jumping into the deep water with your eyes closed.</p> <p>And trusting that it will be okay.</p> <p>Or bungee jumping, which is something that I will never, ever do.</p> <p>So maybe you don’t have to imagine that that’s what you’re going to do.</p> <p>But what if you did?</p> <p>I mean, I’m willing to imagine it, so I’m going to imagine it with you.</p> <p>Right now I’m closing my eyes.</p> <p>I’m imagining myself bungee jumping, trusting that it would be okay.</p> <p>Good.</p> <p>And if you survived this, you can survive a conversation in English</p> <p>where you’re not in control so much.</p> <p>You’ve done harder things in your life.</p> <p>You’ve challenged yourself.</p> <p>Think of a moment or of a situation where you really took the plunge,</p> <p>you really pushed yourself, you really did something scary.</p> <p>We all have that.</p> <p>We have areas in our lives where we’re like, I’m going to do it.</p> <p>And every time you feel the fear of speaking: before a meeting, before a job</p> <p>interview, before a conversation at your kid’s school, with your doctor, with your</p> <p>teacher - every time you feel that, I want you to remember that other situation,</p> <p>where you really conquered a scary moment.</p> <p>And remind yourself that you can do challenging, scary things.</p> <p>And you know how to let go of control.</p> <p>And trust that you will land on your feet or bounce back from the rope.</p> <p>But you’ve done that.</p> <p>And you know how to do it and your body knows how to do it.</p> <p>And you will survive that conversation.</p> <p>That’s it.</p> <p>Thank you so much for being here with me today.</p> <p>If you enjoyed this, please consider subscribing to my podcast,</p>
